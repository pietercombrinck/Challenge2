The script check_iptables.sh was written to be able to run on both RHEL6 and RHEL7 servers. 

The script does:
a. Check if the file /etc/sysconfig/iptables exists. If file does NOT exist, exit
with error message 

b. If file /etc/sysconfig/iptables exists, it exits if the server is a RHEL 7
server otherwise if it is a RHEL 6 server it will save the current running iptables
configuration ONLY IF ALL of the following conditions are met:
	i) The file /etc/sysconfig/iptables was last modified more than an hour ago
	ii) The time the script is running is either during the whole morning hour of 7 or the
	    whole evening hour of 5
